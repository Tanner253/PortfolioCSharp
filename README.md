I am not a javascript developer, so my portfolio shouldnt be in javascript 100%.. so im migrating my javascript portfolio into an asp.net core application


i want to allow all of my projects to run locally, so when you click on each project it takes you to a section of the portfolio website that runs a "virtual" applicaiton and you can return to the portfolio and select another one of my projects. i want to do this while only holding the cost of deployment for 1 webpage, my portfolio.
